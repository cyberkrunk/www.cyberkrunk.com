<p>Notes<br>
Wind and Silver was originally written for Soprano, Violin, Cello and Piano. During the summer of 1989, I attended the Aspen Music School in Colorado. My
roommate was Fred Clarke, a conducting student who was at the time
conducting the Berkeley Chamber Players at Yale. Fred heard a reading
of the quartet version of the piece at Aspen and encouraged me to
write an orchestral version. Beyond that, he even promised to perform
it! These days, few 21-year-old composers get to hear their orchestral music
performed, so I leapt at the opportunity. In a huge burst of creative
energy, working day and night, I completed the orchestration in one
week, and copied all of the parts the next week. (After that, I was
ready for some hiking!) True to his word, Fred conducted the piece
that October. I got a kick from the posters around New Haven that read:
Mahler, Copland, Jankowski. The mp3 is from a cassette master that
was in rather poor shape.</p>
