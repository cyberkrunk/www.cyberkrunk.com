<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><FONT size="4">Wind and Silver was
originally written for Soprano, Violin, Cello and Piano. During the
summer of 1989, I attended the Aspen Music School in Colorado. My
roomate was Fred Clarke, a conducting student who was at the time
conducting the Berkeley Chamber Players at Yale. Fred heard a reading
of the quartet version of the piece at Aspen and encouraged me to
write an orchestral version. Beyond that, he even promised to perform
it! Not many 21-year-old composers get to hear their orchestral music
performed, so I leapt at the opportunity. In a huge burst of creative
energy, working day and night, I completed the orchestration in one
week, and copied all of the parts the next week. (After that, I was
ready for some hiking!) True to his word, Fred conducted the piece
that October. And even though it was a little under-rehearsed, that
performance was one of the happiest moments of my life as a composer.
I got a huge kick from the posters around New Haven that read:
Mahler, Copland, Jankowski. The mp3 is from a cassette master that
was in rather poor shape.</FONT></FONT></P>
